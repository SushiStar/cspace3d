## HAND MADE MAPS
Those maps are hand-made: by drawing pictures and save in \*.png or \*.jpg file or something.
Then those maps are converted to bitmaps(\*.cfg) files. 

Note:
* \*.txt files with name format: DT\* are distance maps of the obstacles of the original maps.
* \*.txt files with name format: VT\* are Voronoi line maps corresponding to each original map.

Those maps share the same star&goal file: handmade.sg
